==============================

Android : sample project for library Android application

Thinks which remain to do : 
1. Add "back to main screen" button at Menu
2. At onRestart() check if they are any internet connection; if not, show an Toast warning message
3. If it's not connected to Internet, exceptions occur : instead of it, show an error message
4. Books list screen is not very ergonomic : small letters and no buttons make that it is difficult to click on book title and load it
5. Do "loaded X books from 500" at books list screen
6. When deleting a book from waiting list, remove the line from list
7. "My account" : tabs don't work properly. For exemple, when I came to "Preferencies" tab, "Credentials" tab is marked as active and when I click to "Credentials" tab, the tab content doesn't change
8. After sending a SMS, show different screen with Toast message
